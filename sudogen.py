SUDOKU (SOLUTION) BOARD GENERATION
1. Sudoku board is built row by row with recursion
2. For every cell, its row, square and col possible values are checked
3. If no solution can be found, the row is re-built via recursion
4. If the row is re-built too many times, break out of the recursion
and re-build the row before.
5. Continue until every row is built.

There is some RNG involved for every iteration as
the row-generating algorithm is not aware what extra constraints are
added when it inserts a randomly chosen value in. The extra constraints
may make the sdku unsolvable from the get-go, hence the need to move back a row.
