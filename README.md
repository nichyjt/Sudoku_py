# Sudoku_py

## About
This is a personal mini-project where I made a functional Sudoku game using the Tkinter framework.  
This is a learning exercise for Tkinter and coding with recursion for fun.

### Pre-Requsites / Dependencies
1. Tkinter
2. Python 3.9
3. Pandas, Numpy and Matplotlib for `sudogenanalysis`

This build was tested on a Windows 10 machine.

## Repo Highlights
### 1.  **Full Sudoku Board Algorithms**  
  sudogen, sudogen1, sudogen2 and sudogen3 are scripts to generate a full sudoku grid (2D List) using recursive algorithms with some variation between them.  
### sudogen
The most efficient script. It is a greedy and naiive algorithm, building the sudoku grid row by row randomly, choosing a number to populate each cell from a pool of possible values.    
When there are no solutions possible while building the row, the entire row is thrown away and re-built recursively.   
There may be a case where no permutation of values in the row can satisfy sudoku rules due to the arrangement of the previous row.  
A recursion counter is used to prevent infinite looping. When its threshold is met, the current row and the row before it are cleared and re-built.  

### sudogen2
sudogen2 operates similarly to sudogen. However, it allows backtracking within a row.  
If all possible permutations in the row do not produce a valid solution, the row and the row before it is thrown away and re-built.

### sudogen3  
sudogen3 implements a more thorough backtracking algorithm, tracking all failed values for every cell in the sudoku matrix.  

### 2. Algorithm Analysis 
  I compared the efficiency of the algorithms based on how many ```getAvailValues()``` calls are made to generate the matrix. (sudogenanalysis.py)  
  Each function call relates to how many cells have been built.
  The graphs made with matplotlib are included in /sudogen_graphs.
  
### 3. Sudoku Game
  A functional Sudoku GUI game with the ability to change difficulty and check value correctness.  
  For now, the game will only start if sudoku.py is called from the terminal. 
 
## How to play
If you wish to play the game:

1. Ensure you have the pre-requisites as mentioned above first.
2. Download `sudogen.py`, `sudoku.py` and `sudodatahandler`
3. Run sudoku.py
